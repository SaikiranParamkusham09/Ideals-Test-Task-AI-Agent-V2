# Solution Architecture

## System Design Overview
The recruitment system implements an agentic architecture that autonomously manages the hiring process. The system uses Streamlit for the frontend interface, Python for backend processing, and JSON for data storage. The architecture integrates AI-powered decision making with automated workflow management.

## AI/ML Components
The system implements an intelligent agent using Google's Gemini AI model for candidate assessment. The agent analyzes resumes, makes decisions based on predefined criteria, and provides structured feedback. The model is integrated through a secure API connection with basic error handling.

## Integration Architecture
The system implements a multi-agent architecture with specialized agents:
- Intelligence Agent (Gemini AI): Handles candidate assessment
- Communication Agent (SMTP): Manages email communications
- Coordination Agent (Calendly): Handles interview scheduling

## Data Flow
The agentic workflow includes:
- Perception: Data collection and input
- Processing: AI assessment and analysis
- Decision: Stage progression logic
- Action: Communication and scheduling
- State: Data persistence

## Security Considerations
Security is implemented through environment variables for API keys and basic error handling. The system uses secure communication channels for agent interactions.

## Technical Requirements
The system requires Python 3.8+, specific libraries (streamlit, pandas, google-generativeai, python-dotenv), and external service subscriptions (Gemini AI, SMTP, Calendly).
