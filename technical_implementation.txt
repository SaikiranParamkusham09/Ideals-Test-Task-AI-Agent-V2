Technical Implementation Document
================================

1. API Integration Code Samples
------------------------------
a) Gemini AI Integration
```python
# Configure Gemini API
GOOGLE_API_KEY = os.getenv('GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY')
genai.configure(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro')

# Example API call with error handling
try:
    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    assessment = response.text
except Exception as e:
    st.error(f"Error assessing candidate: {e}")
    assessment = None

# Rate limiting implementation
time.sleep(1)  # Basic rate limiting
```
This code snippet demonstrates the integration with Google's Gemini AI API. It includes secure API key management through environment variables, error handling for API calls, and basic rate limiting to prevent API abuse. The model is configured to use the gemini-1.5-pro version, which provides advanced capabilities for candidate assessment.

b) Email Service Integration
```python
# SMTP Configuration with security
SMTP_HOST = os.getenv('SMTP_HOST')
SMTP_PORT = int(os.getenv('SMTP_PORT'))
SMTP_USERNAME = os.getenv('SMTP_USERNAME')
SMTP_PASSWORD = os.getenv('SMTP_PASSWORD')

# Email sending function with error handling
def send_email(to_email, subject, body):
    try:
        msg = MIMEMultipart()
        msg['From'] = SMTP_USERNAME
        msg['To'] = to_email
        msg['Subject'] = subject
        msg.attach(MIMEText(body, 'html'))
        
        with smtplib.SMTP(SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT) as server:
            server.starttls()  # Enable TLS
            server.login(SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD)
            server.send_message(msg)
        
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error sending email: {e}")
        return False
```
This code shows the implementation of secure email functionality using SMTP. It includes secure credential management, TLS encryption for secure communication, and comprehensive error handling. The function supports HTML email content and provides feedback on the success or failure of email sending operations.

c) Calendly Integration
```python
# Calendly Configuration with API key management
CALENDLY_API_KEY = os.getenv('CALENDLY_API_KEY')
CALENDLY_BASE_URL = "https://api.calendly.com/v2"
CALENDLY_SCHEDULING_LINK = "https://calendly.com/saikiran-paramkusham09"

# Scheduling link generation with parameters
scheduling_link = f"{CALENDLY_SCHEDULING_LINK}?email={candidate_email}&name={candidate_name}&job={job_title}"
```
This code demonstrates the integration with Calendly for interview scheduling. It includes secure API key management and dynamic scheduling link generation with pre-filled candidate information. The implementation supports custom parameters for a personalized scheduling experience.

2. AI Prompt Engineering Example
